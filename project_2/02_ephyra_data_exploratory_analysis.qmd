# Looking at total count of Ephyra and width

```{r}
ephyra_data |> 
  filter(width != 0) |> 
  group_by(temperature, water) |> 
  summarize(n = n(), avg_width = mean(width))
```

It looks like the average width is largely determined by the temperature, lets look at a box plot by treatment.

```{r}
ephyra_data |> 
  filter(width != 0) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = treatment, y = width)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

It seems there is indeed a difference, driven primarily by the temperature of the water.
