# Are the differences between samples significantly different from one another

For the polyp DNA samples:

```{r}
polyp_Cq <- DNA_data |> 
  filter(Sample_Type == "Polyp")
```

```{r}
polyp_model <- lm(Cq ~ water*temperature + time, data = polyp_Cq)
summary(polyp_model)
anova(polyp_model)
```

Yes, they are different.

For the water DNA sample:

```{r}
water_Cq = DNA_data |> 
  filter(Sample_Type == "Water")
```

Model:

```{r}
water_model = lm(Cq ~ temperature*water, data = water_Cq)
anova(water_model)
```

Yes, they are significantly different.
