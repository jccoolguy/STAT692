# Experimental Unit

Beaker

# Measurement Unit

Various specimen in beaker (bud, ephyra, polyp).

# Homogeneous Experimental Unit

All polyps come from same tank.

# Block

No blocking.

# Factors and Levels

Water temperature $T=\{20\text{ low},28 \text{ ambient}, 33 \text{ high}\}$ . Fixed factor with three levels.

Water treatment $W = \{\text{ASW} (\text{Regular Artifical Seawater)}, \text{Sterilized anti-biotic treated ASW}\}$. Fixed factor with two levels.

# Treatment Structure

3x2

# Repeated Measurements

Count Data: Counts of Buds/Ephyra/Polyp tracked biweekly. So 11 times each.
